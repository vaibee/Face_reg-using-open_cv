## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition: The program uses Haar cascades or deep learning models to detect faces and applies machine learning algorithms to recognize them.
- Face recognition from images/videos: You can also provide a pre-recorded image or video file to detect and recognize faces.
- Customizable options: You can adjust various parameters such as face detection confidence thresholds, recognition algorithms, and more.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the program:

- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- NumPy: `pip install numpy`
- Pillow: `pip install pillow`
